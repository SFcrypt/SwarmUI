# Status

This project is in **Beta** status. This means for most tasks, Swarm has excellent tooling available to you, but there is much more planned. Swarm is recommended as an ideal UI for most users, beginners and pros alike. There are still some things to be worked out.

Beginner users will love Swarm's primary Generate tab interface, making it easy to generate anything with a variety of powerful features. Advanced users may favor the Comfy Workflow tab to get the unrestricted raw graph, but will still have reason to come back to the Generate tab for convenience features (image editor, auto-workflow-generation, etc) and powertools (eg Grid Generator).

Those interested in helping push Swarm from Beta to a Full ready-for-anything perfected Release status are welcome to submit PRs (read the [Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) document first), and you can contact us here on GitHub or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/q2y38cqjNw). I highly recommend reaching out to ask about plans for a feature before PRing it. There may already be specific plans or even a work in progress.

Key feature targets not yet implemented:
- Better mobile browser support
- full detail "Current Model" display in UI, separate from the model selector (probably as a tab within the batch sidebar?)
- LLM-assisted prompting (there's an extension for it, but LLM control should be natively supported)
- convenient direct-distribution of Swarm as a program ([Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [Blazor Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-blazor-hybrid/), or an Electron app?)
